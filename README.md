## Getting started

This library relies on the [tch](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs) crate for bindings to the C++ Libtorch API.
The libtorch library is required can be downloaded either automatically or manually. The following provides a reference on how to set-up your environment
to use these bindings, please refer to the [tch](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs) for detailed information or support.

Furthermore, this library relies on a cache folder for downloading pre-trained models. 
This cache location defaults to `~/.cache/.rustbert`, but can be changed by setting the `RUSTBERT_CACHE` environment variable. Note that the language models used by this library are in the order of the 100s of MBs to GBs.

### Manual installation (recommended)

1. Download `libtorch` from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/. This package requires `v2.1`: if this version is no longer available on the "get started" page,
the file should be accessible by modifying the target link, for example `https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu118/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.1.1%2Bcu118.zip` for a Linux version with CUDA11. **NOTE:** When using `rust-bert` as dependency from [crates.io](https://crates.io), please check the required `LIBTORCH` on the published package [readme](https://crates.io/crates/rust-bert) as it may differ from the version documented here (applying to the current repository version).
2. Extract the library to a location of your choice
3. Set the following environment variables
##### Linux:
```bash
export LIBTORCH=/path/to/libtorch
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LIBTORCH}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

##### Windows
```powershell
$Env:LIBTORCH = "X:\path\to\libtorch"
$Env:Path += ";X:\path\to\libtorch\lib"
```

#### macOS + Homebrew
```bash
brew install pytorch jq
export LIBTORCH=$(brew --cellar pytorch)/$(brew info --json pytorch | jq -r '.[0].installed[0].version')
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LIBTORCH}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

### Automatic installation

Alternatively, you can let the `build` script automatically download the `libtorch` library for you. The `download-libtorch` feature flag needs to be enabled.
The CPU version of libtorch will be downloaded by default. To download a CUDA version, please set the environment variable `TORCH_CUDA_VERSION` to `cu118`.
Note that the libtorch library is large (order of several GBs for the CUDA-enabled version) and the first build may therefore take several minutes to complete.

### Verifying installation

Verify your installation (and linking with libtorch) by adding the `rust-bert` dependency to your `Cargo.toml` or by cloning the rust-bert source and running an example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:guillaume-be/rust-bert.git
cd rust-bert
cargo run --example sentence_embeddings
```

## ONNX Support (Optional)

ONNX support can be enabled via the optional `onnx` feature. This crate then leverages the [ort](https://github.com/pykeio/ort) crate with bindings to the onnxruntime C++ library. We refer the user to this page project for further installation instructions/support.
1. Enable the optional `onnx` feature. The `rust-bert` crate does not include any optional dependencies for `ort`, the end user should select the set of features that would be adequate for pulling the required `onnxruntime` C++ library. 
2. The current recommended installation is to use dynamic linking by pointing to an existing library location. Use the `load-dynamic` cargo feature for `ort`.
3. set the `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` to point to the location of downloaded onnxruntime library (`onnxruntime.dll`/`libonnxruntime.so`/`libonnxruntime.dylib` depending on the operating system). These can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases) of the onnxruntime project

Most architectures (including encoders, decoders and encoder-decoders) are supported. the library aims at keeping compatibility with models exported using the [optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum) library. A detailed guide on how to export a Transformer model to ONNX using optimum is available at https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/exporters/onnx/usage_guides/export_a_model
The resources used to create ONNX models are similar to those based on Pytorch, replacing the pytorch by the ONNX model. Since ONNX models are less flexible than their Pytorch counterparts in the handling of optional arguments, exporting a decoder or encoder-decoder model to ONNX will usually result in multiple files. These files are expected (but not all are necessary) for use in this library as per the table below:

| Architecture                | Encoder file  | Decoder without past file | Decoder with past file  |
|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
|  Encoder (e.g. BERT)        | required      | not used                  | not used                |
|  Decoder (e.g. GPT2)        | not used      | required                  | optional                |
| Encoder-decoder (e.g. BART) | required      | required                  | optional                |

Note that the computational efficiency will drop when the `decoder with past` file is optional but not provided
since the model will not used cached past keys and values for the attention mechanism, leading to a high number of
redundant computations. The Optimum library offers export options to ensure such a `decoder with past` model file is created.
he base encoder and decoder model architecture are available (and exposed for convenience) in the `encoder` and `decoder` modules, respectively.

Generation models (pure decoder or encoder/decoder architectures) are available in the `models` module.
ost pipelines are available for ONNX model checkpoints, including sequence classification, zero-shot classification,
token classification (including named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging), question answering, text generation, summarization and translation.
These models use the same configuration and tokenizer files as their Pytorch counterparts when used in a pipeline. Examples leveraging ONNX models are given in the `./examples` directory

## Ready-to-use pipelines
	
Based on Hugging Face's pipelines, ready to use end-to-end NLP pipelines are available as part of this crate. The following capabilities are currently available:

<details>
<summary> <b>1. Question Answering</b> </summary>

Extractive question answering from a given question and context. DistilBERT model fine-tuned on SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)

```rust
    let qa_model = QuestionAnsweringModel::new(Default::default())?;
                                                        
    let question = String::from("Where does Amy live ?");
    let context = String::from("Amy lives in Amsterdam");

    let answers = qa_model.predict(&[QaInput { question, context }], 1, 32);
```

<details>
<summary> <b>2. Translation </b> </summary>

Translation pipeline supporting a broad range of source and target languages. Leverages two main architectures for translation tasks:
- Marian-based models, for specific source/target combinations
- M2M100 models allowing for direct translation between 100 languages (at a higher computational cost and lower performance for some selected languages)

Marian-based pretrained models for the following language pairs are readily available in the library - but the user can import any Pytorch-based
model for predictions
- English <-> French
- English <-> Spanish
- English <-> Portuguese
- English <-> Italian
- English <-> Catalan
- English <-> German
- English <-> Russian
- English <-> Chinese
- English <-> Dutch
- English <-> Swedish
- English <-> Arabic
- English <-> Hebrew
- English <-> Hindi
- French <-> German

For languages not supported by the proposed pretrained Marian models, the user can leverage a M2M100 model supporting direct translation between 100 languages (without intermediate English translation)
The full list of supported languages is available in the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/rust-bert/latest/rust_bert/pipelines/translation/enum.Language.html)

 ```rust
 use rust_bert::pipelines::translation::{Language, TranslationModelBuilder};
 fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
 let model = TranslationModelBuilder::new()
         .with_source_languages(vec![Language::English])
         .with_target_languages(vec![Language::Spanish, Language::French, Language::Italian])
         .create_model()?;
     let input_text = "This is a sentence to be translated";
     let output = model.translate(&[input_text], None, Language::Spanish)?;
     for sentence in output {
         println!("{}", sentence);
     }
     Ok(())
 }
 ```
Output:
```
Il s'agit d'une phrase à traduire

<summary> <b>3. Summarization </b> </summary>

Abstractive summarization using a pretrained BART model.

```rust
    let summarization_model = SummarizationModel::new(Default::default())?;
                                                        
    let input = ["In findings published Tuesday in Cornell University's arXiv by a team of scientists \
from the University of Montreal and a separate report published Wednesday in Nature Astronomy by a team \
from University College London (UCL), the presence of water vapour was confirmed in the atmosphere of K2-18b, \
a planet circling a star in the constellation Leo. This is the first such discovery in a planet in its star's \
habitable zone — not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist. The Montreal team, led by Björn Benneke, \
used data from the NASA's Hubble telescope to assess changes in the light coming from K2-18b's star as the planet \
passed between it and Earth. They found that certain wavelengths of light, which are usually absorbed by water, \
weakened when the planet was in the way, indicating not only does K2-18b have an atmosphere, but the atmosphere \
contains water in vapour form. The team from UCL then analyzed the Montreal team's data using their own software \
and confirmed their conclusion. This was not the first time scientists have found signs of water on an exoplanet, \
but previous discoveries were made on planets with high temperatures or other pronounced differences from Earth. \
\"This is the first potentially habitable planet where the temperature is right and where we now know there is water,\" \
said UCL astronomer Angelos Tsiaras. \"It's the best candidate for habitability right now.\" \"It's a good sign\", \
said Ryan Cloutier of the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was not one of either study's authors. \
\"Overall,\" he continued, \"the presence of water in its atmosphere certainly improves the prospect of K2-18b being \
a potentially habitable planet, but further observations will be required to say for sure. \"
K2-18b was first identified in 2015 by the Kepler space telescope. It is about 110 light-years from Earth and larger \
but less dense. Its star, a red dwarf, is cooler than the Sun, but the planet's orbit is much closer, such that a year \
on K2-18b lasts 33 Earth days. According to The Guardian, astronomers were optimistic that NASA's James Webb space \
telescope — scheduled for launch in 2021 — and the European Space Agency's 2028 ARIEL program, could reveal more \
about exoplanets like K2-18b."];

    let output = summarization_model.summarize(&input);
```
(example from: [WikiNews](https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Astronomers_find_water_vapour_in_atmosphere_of_exoplanet_K2-18b))

Output:
```
"Scientists have found water vapour on K2-18b, a planet 110 light-years from Earth. 
This is the first such discovery in a planet in its star's habitable zone. 
The planet is not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist."

<summary> <b>4. Dialogue Model </b> </summary>

Conversation model based on Microsoft's [DialoGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/DialoGPT).
This pipeline allows the generation of single or multi-turn conversations between a human and a model.
The DialoGPT's page states that
> The human evaluation results indicate that the response generated from DialoGPT is comparable to human response quality
> under a single-turn conversation Turing test. ([DialoGPT repository](https://github.com/microsoft/DialoGPT))

The model uses a `ConversationManager` to keep track of active conversations and generate responses to them.

```rust
use rust_bert::pipelines::conversation::{ConversationModel, ConversationManager};

let conversation_model = ConversationModel::new(Default::default());
let mut conversation_manager = ConversationManager::new();

let conversation_id = conversation_manager.create("Going to the movies tonight - any suggestions?");
let output = conversation_model.generate_responses(&mut conversation_manager);
```
Example output:
```
"The Big Lebowski."
```

<details>
<summary> <b>5. Natural Language Generation </b> </summary>

Generate language based on a prompt. GPT2 and GPT available as base models.
Include techniques such as beam search, top-k and nucleus sampling, temperature setting and repetition penalty.
Supports batch generation of sentences from several prompts. Sequences will be left-padded with the model's padding token if present, the unknown token otherwise.
This may impact the results, it is recommended to submit prompts of similar length for best results

```rust
    let model = GPT2Generator::new(Default::default())?;

    let input_context_2 = "The cat was";

    let generate_options = GenerateOptions {
        max_length: 30,
        ..Default::default()
    };

    let output = model.generate(Some(&[input_context_1, input_context_2]), generate_options);
```
Example output:
```
[
    "The dog's owners, however, did not want to be named. According to the lawsuit, the animal's owner, a 29-year"
    "The dog has always been part of the family. \"He was always going to be my dog and he was always looking out for me"
    "The dog has been able to stay in the home for more than three months now. \"It's a very good dog. She's"
    "The cat was discovered earlier this month in the home of a relative of the deceased. The cat\'s owner, who wished to remain anonymous,"
    "The cat was pulled from the street by two-year-old Jazmine.\"I didn't know what to do,\" she said"
    "The cat was attacked by two stray dogs and was taken to a hospital. Two other cats were also injured in the attack and are being treated."

## Benchmarks

For simple pipelines (sequence classification, tokens classification, question answering) the performance between Python and Rust is expected to be comparable. This is because the most expensive part of these pipeline is the language model itself, sharing a common implementation in the Torch backend. The [End-to-end NLP Pipelines in Rust](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlposs-1.4/) provides a benchmarks section covering all pipelines.

For text generation tasks (summarization, translation, conversation, free text generation), significant benefits can be expected (up to 2 to 4 times faster processing depending on the input and application). The article [Accelerating text generation with Rust](https://guillaume-be.github.io/2020-11-21/generation_benchmarks) focuses on these text generation applications and provides more details on the performance comparison to Python.

## Loading pretrained and custom model weights

The base model and task-specific heads are also available for users looking to expose their own transformer based models.
Examples on how to prepare the date using a native tokenizers Rust library are available in `./examples` for BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, GPT, GPT2 and BART.
Note that when importing models from Pytorch, the convention for parameters naming needs to be aligned with the Rust schema. Loading of the pre-trained weights will fail if any of the model parameters weights cannot be found in the weight files.
If this quality check is to be skipped, an alternative method `load_partial` can be invoked from the variables store.

Pretrained models are available on Hugging face's [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=rust) and can be loaded using `RemoteResources` defined in this library.
A conversion utility script is included in `./utils` to convert Pytorch weights to a set of weights compatible with this library. This script requires Python and `torch` to be set-up, and can be used as follows:
`python ./utils/convert_model.py path/to/pytorch_model.bin` where `path/to/pytorch_model.bin` is the location of the original Pytorch weights.
