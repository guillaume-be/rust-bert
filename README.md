## Ready-to-use pipelines

Based on Huggingface's pipelines, ready to use end-to-end NLP pipelines are available as part of this crate. The following capabilities are currently available:
#### 1. Question Answering
Extractive question answering from a given question and context. DistilBERT model finetuned on SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)

```rust
    let device = Device::cuda_if_available();
    let qa_model = QuestionAnsweringModel::new(vocab_path,
                                               config_path,
                                               weights_path, device)?;
                                                        
    let question = String::from("Where does Amy live ?");
    let context = String::from("Amy lives in Amsterdam");

    let answers = qa_model.predict(&vec!(QaInput { question, context }), 1, 32);
```

Output:
```
[Answer { score: 0.9976814985275269, start: 13, end: 21, answer: "Amsterdam" }]
```

#### 2. Summarization
Abstractive summarization using a pretrained BART model.

```rust
    let device = Device::cuda_if_available();
    let summarization_model = SummarizationModel::new(vocab_path, 
                                                      merges_path, 
                                                      config_path, 
                                                      weights_path,
                                                      summarization_config, 
                                                      device)?;
                                                        
    let input = ["In findings published Tuesday in Cornell University's arXiv by a team of scientists \
from the University of Montreal and a separate report published Wednesday in Nature Astronomy by a team \
from University College London (UCL), the presence of water vapour was confirmed in the atmosphere of K2-18b, \
a planet circling a star in the constellation Leo. This is the first such discovery in a planet in its star's \
habitable zone — not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist. The Montreal team, led by Björn Benneke, \
used data from the NASA's Hubble telescope to assess changes in the light coming from K2-18b's star as the planet \
passed between it and Earth. They found that certain wavelengths of light, which are usually absorbed by water, \
weakened when the planet was in the way, indicating not only does K2-18b have an atmosphere, but the atmosphere \
contains water in vapour form. The team from UCL then analyzed the Montreal team's data using their own software \
and confirmed their conclusion. This was not the first time scientists have found signs of water on an exoplanet, \
but previous discoveries were made on planets with high temperatures or other pronounced differences from Earth. \
\"This is the first potentially habitable planet where the temperature is right and where we now know there is water,\" \
said UCL astronomer Angelos Tsiaras. \"It's the best candidate for habitability right now.\" \"It's a good sign\", \
said Ryan Cloutier of the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was not one of either study's authors. \
\"Overall,\" he continued, \"the presence of water in its atmosphere certainly improves the prospect of K2-18b being \
a potentially habitable planet, but further observations will be required to say for sure. \"
K2-18b was first identified in 2015 by the Kepler space telescope. It is about 110 light-years from Earth and larger \
but less dense. Its star, a red dwarf, is cooler than the Sun, but the planet's orbit is much closer, such that a year \
on K2-18b lasts 33 Earth days. According to The Guardian, astronomers were optimistic that NASA's James Webb space \
telescope — scheduled for launch in 2021 — and the European Space Agency's 2028 ARIEL program, could reveal more \
about exoplanets like K2-18b."];

    let output = summarization_model.summarize(&input);
```
(example from: [WikiNews](https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Astronomers_find_water_vapour_in_atmosphere_of_exoplanet_K2-18b))

Output:
```
"Scientists have found water vapour on K2-18b, a planet 110 light-years from Earth. 
This is the first such discovery in a planet in its star's habitable zone. 
The planet is not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist."
```

#### 3. Natural Language Generation
Generate language based on a prompt. GPT2 and GPT available as base models.
Include techniques such as beam search, top-k and nucleus sampling, temperature setting and repetition penalty.
Supports batch generation of sentences from several prompts. Sequences will be left-padded with the model's padding token if present, the unknown token otherwise.
This may impact the results and it is recommended to submit prompts of similar length for best results

```rust
    let device = Device::cuda_if_available();
    let model = GPT2Generator::new(vocab_path, merges_path, config_path, weights_path, device)?;
                                                        
    let input_context_1 = "The dog";
    let input_context_2 = "The cat was";

    let output = model.generate(Some(vec!(input_context_1, input_context_2)), 0, 30, true, false, 
                                5, 1.2, 0, 0.9, 1.0, 1.0, 3, 3, None);
```
Example output:
```
[
    "The dog's owners, however, did not want to be named. According to the lawsuit, the animal's owner, a 29-year"
    "The dog has always been part of the family. \"He was always going to be my dog and he was always looking out for me"
    "The dog has been able to stay in the home for more than three months now. "It's a very good dog. She's"
    "The cat was discovered earlier this month in the home of a relative of the deceased. The cat\'s owner, who wished to remain anonymous,"
    "The cat was pulled from the street by two-year-old Jazmine.\"I didn't know what to do,\" she said"
    "The cat was attacked by two stray dogs and was taken to a hospital. Two other cats were also injured in the attack and are being treated."
]
```

#### 4. Sentiment analysis
Predicts the binary sentiment for a sentence. DistilBERT model finetuned on SST-2.
```rust
    let device = Device::cuda_if_available();
    let sentiment_classifier = SentimentClassifier::new(vocab_path,
                                                        config_path,
                                                        weights_path, device)?;
                                                        
    let input = [
        "Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preachy or boring.",
        "This film tried to be too many things all at once: stinging political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family values promo...",
        "If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie. If you are young or old then you will love this movie, hell even my mom liked it.",
    ];

    let output = sentiment_classifier.predict(&input);
```
(Example courtesy of [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com))

Output:
```
[
    Sentiment { polarity: Positive, score: 0.9981985493795946 },
    Sentiment { polarity: Negative, score: 0.9927982091903687 },
    Sentiment { polarity: Positive, score: 0.9997248985164333 }
]
```

#### 5. Named Entity Recognition
Extracts entities (Person, Location, Organization, Miscellaneous) from text. BERT cased large model finetuned on CoNNL03, contributed by the [MDZ Digital Library team at the Bavarian State Library](https://github.com/dbmdz)
```rust
    let device = Device::cuda_if_available();
    let ner_model = NERModel::new(vocab_path,
                                  config_path,
                                  weights_path, device)?;

    let input = [
        "My name is Amy. I live in Paris.",
        "Paris is a city in France."
    ];
    
    let output = ner_model.predict(&input);
```
Output:
```
[
    Entity { word: "Amy", score: 0.9986, label: "I-PER" }
    Entity { word: "Paris", score: 0.9985, label: "I-LOC" }
    Entity { word: "Paris", score: 0.9988, label: "I-LOC" }
    Entity { word: "France", score: 0.9993, label: "I-LOC" }
]
```

## Base models

The base model and task-specific heads are also available for users looking to expose their own transformer based models.
Examples on how to prepare the date using a native tokenizers Rust library are available in `./examples` for BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, GPT, GPT2 and BART.
Note that when importing models from Pytorch, the convention for parameters naming needs to be aligned with the Rust schema. Loading of the pre-trained weights will fail if any of the model parameters weights cannot be found in the weight files.
If this quality check is to be skipped, an alternative method `load_partial` can be invoked from the variables store.

## Setup

The model configuration and vocabulary are downloaded directly from Huggingface's repository.

The model weights need to be converter to a binary format that can be read by Libtorch (the original `.bin` files are pickles and cannot be used directly). A Python script for downloading the required files & running the necessary steps is provided.

1. Compile the package: `cargo build --release`
2. Download the model files & perform necessary conversions
   - Set-up a virtual environment and install dependencies
   - run the conversion script `python /utils/download-dependencies_{MODEL_TO_DOWNLOAD}.py`. The dependencies will be downloaded to the user's home directory, under `~/rustbert/{}`
3. Run the example `cargo run --release`
