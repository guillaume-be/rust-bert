//! and confirmed their conclusion. This was not the first time scientists have found signs of water on an exoplanet,
//! but previous discoveries were made on planets with high temperatures or other pronounced differences from Earth.
//! \"This is the first potentially habitable planet where the temperature is right and where we now know there is water,\"

//! \"Overall,\" he continued, \"the presence of water in its atmosphere certainly improves the prospect of K2-18b being
//! a potentially habitable planet, but further observations will be required to say for sure. \"
//! K2-18b was first identified in 2015 by the Kepler space telescope. It is about 110 light-years from Earth and larger
//! but less dense. Its star, a red dwarf, is cooler than the Sun, but the planet's orbit is much closer, such that a year
//! on K2-18b lasts 33 Earth days. According to The Guardian, astronomers were optimistic that NASA's James Webb space
//! telescope — scheduled for launch in 2021 — and the European Space Agency's 2028 ARIEL program, could reveal more
