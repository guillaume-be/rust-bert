//! # Ready-to-use NLP pipelines and Transformer-based models
//!
//! Rust-native state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing models and pipelines. Port of Hugging Face's [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), using the [tch-rs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs) crate and pre-processing from [rust-tokenizers](https://github.com/guillaume-be/rust-tokenizers). Supports multi-threaded tokenization and GPU inference.
//! This repository exposes the model base architecture, task-specific heads (see below) and [ready-to-use pipelines](#ready-to-use-pipelines). [Benchmarks](#benchmarks) are available at the end of this document.
//!
//! Get started with tasks including question answering, named entity recognition, translation, summarization, text generation, conversational agents and more in just a few lines of code:
//! ```no_run
//! use rust_bert::pipelines::question_answering::{QaInput, QuestionAnsweringModel};
//!
//! # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//! let qa_model = QuestionAnsweringModel::new(Default::default())?;
//!
//! let question = String::from("Where does Amy live ?");
//! let context = String::from("Amy lives in Amsterdam");
//! let answers = qa_model.predict(&[QaInput { question, context }], 1, 32);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Output:
//! ```no_run
//! # use rust_bert::pipelines::question_answering::Answer;
//! # let output =
//! [Answer {
//!     score: 0.9976,
//!     start: 13,
//!     end: 21,
//!     answer: String::from("Amsterdam"),
//! }]
//! # ;

//! # Getting started
//!
//! This library relies on the [tch](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs) crate for bindings to the C++ Libtorch API.
//! The libtorch library is required can be downloaded either automatically or manually. The following provides a reference on how to set-up your environment
//! to use these bindings, please refer to the [tch](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs) for detailed information or support.
//!
//! Furthermore, this library relies on a cache folder for downloading pre-trained models.
//! This cache location defaults to `~/.cache/.rustbert`, but can be changed by setting the `RUSTBERT_CACHE` environment variable. Note that the language models used by this library are in the order of the 100s of MBs to GBs.
//!
//! ### Manual installation (recommended)
//!
//! 1. Download `libtorch` from <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>. This package requires `v1.12.0`: if this version is no longer available on the "get started" page,
//! the file should be accessible by modifying the target link, for example `https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu116/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-1.12.0%2Bcu116.zip` for a Linux version with CUDA11.
//! 2. Extract the library to a location of your choice
//! 3. Set the following environment variables
//! ##### Linux:
//! ```bash
//! export LIBTORCH=/path/to/libtorch
//! export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LIBTORCH}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
//! ```
//!
//! ##### Windows
//! ```powershell
//! $Env:LIBTORCH = "X:\path\to\libtorch"
//! $Env:Path += ";X:\path\to\libtorch\lib"
//! ```
//!
//! ### Automatic installation
//!
//! Alternatively, you can let the `build` script automatically download the `libtorch` library for you.
//! The CPU version of libtorch will be downloaded by default. To download a CUDA version, please set the environment variable `TORCH_CUDA_VERSION` to `cu116`.
//! Note that the libtorch library is large (order of several GBs for the CUDA-enabled version) and the first build may therefore take several minutes to complete.
//!
//! # Ready-to-use pipelines
//!
//! Based on Hugging Face's pipelines, ready to use end-to-end NLP pipelines are available as part of this crate. More information on these can be found in the [`pipelines` module](./pipelines/index.html)

//! <summary> <b>2. Translation </b> </summary>
//!
//! Translation pipeline supporting a broad range of source and target languages. Leverages two main architectures for translation tasks:
//! - Marian-based models, for specific source/target combinations
//! - M2M100 models allowing for direct translation between 100 languages (at a higher computational cost and lower performance for some selected languages)
//!
//! Marian-based pretrained models for the following language pairs are readily available in the library - but the user can import any Pytorch-based
//! model for predictions
//! - English <-> French
//! - English <-> Spanish
//! - English <-> Portuguese
//! - English <-> Italian
//! - English <-> Catalan
//! - English <-> German
//! - English <-> Russian
//! - English <-> Chinese
//! - English <-> Dutch
//! - English <-> Swedish
//! - English <-> Arabic
//! - English <-> Hebrew
//! - English <-> Hindi
//! - French <-> German
//!
//! For languages not supported by the proposed pretrained Marian models, the user can leverage a M2M100 model supporting direct translation between 100 languages (without intermediate English translation)
//! The full list of supported languages is available in the [`pipelines` module](./pipelines/translation/enum.Language.html)

//! from the University of Montreal and a separate report published Wednesday in Nature Astronomy by a team
//! from University College London (UCL), the presence of water vapour was confirmed in the atmosphere of K2-18b,
//! a planet circling a star in the constellation Leo. This is the first such discovery in a planet in its star's
//! habitable zone — not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist. The Montreal team, led by Björn Benneke,
//! used data from the NASA's Hubble telescope to assess changes in the light coming from K2-18b's star as the planet
//! passed between it and Earth. They found that certain wavelengths of light, which are usually absorbed by water,
//! weakened when the planet was in the way, indicating not only does K2-18b have an atmosphere, but the atmosphere
//! contains water in vapour form. The team from UCL then analyzed the Montreal team's data using their own software
//! and confirmed their conclusion. This was not the first time scientists have found signs of water on an exoplanet,
//! but previous discoveries were made on planets with high temperatures or other pronounced differences from Earth.
//! \"This is the first potentially habitable planet where the temperature is right and where we now know there is water,\"
//! said UCL astronomer Angelos Tsiaras. \"It's the best candidate for habitability right now.\" \"It's a good sign\",
//! said Ryan Cloutier of the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was not one of either study's authors.
//! \"Overall,\" he continued, \"the presence of water in its atmosphere certainly improves the prospect of K2-18b being
//! a potentially habitable planet, but further observations will be required to say for sure. \"
//! K2-18b was first identified in 2015 by the Kepler space telescope. It is about 110 light-years from Earth and larger
//! but less dense. Its star, a red dwarf, is cooler than the Sun, but the planet's orbit is much closer, such that a year
//! on K2-18b lasts 33 Earth days. According to The Guardian, astronomers were optimistic that NASA's James Webb space
//! telescope — scheduled for launch in 2021 — and the European Space Agency's 2028 ARIEL program, could reveal more
//! about exoplanets like K2-18b."];

//!
//! Generate sentence embeddings (vector representation). These can be used for applications including dense information retrieval.
//!```no_run
//! # use rust_bert::pipelines::sentence_embeddings::{SentenceEmbeddingsBuilder, SentenceEmbeddingsModelType};
//! # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//!    let model = SentenceEmbeddingsBuilder::remote(
//!             SentenceEmbeddingsModelType::AllMiniLmL12V2

//! ## Benchmarks
//!
//! For simple pipelines (sequence classification, tokens classification, question answering) the performance between Python and Rust is expected to be comparable. This is because the most expensive part of these pipeline is the language model itself, sharing a common implementation in the Torch backend. The [End-to-end NLP Pipelines in Rust](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlposs-1.4/) provides a benchmarks section covering all pipelines.
//!
//! For text generation tasks (summarization, translation, conversation, free text generation), significant benefits can be expected (up to 2 to 4 times faster processing depending on the input and application). The article [Accelerating text generation with Rust](https://guillaume-be.github.io/2020-11-21/generation_benchmarks) focuses on these text generation applications and provides more details on the performance comparison to Python.
//!
//! ## Loading pretrained and custom model weights
//!
//! The base model and task-specific heads are also available for users looking to expose their own transformer based models.
//! Examples on how to prepare the date using a native tokenizers Rust library are available in `./examples` for BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, GPT, GPT2 and BART.
//! Note that when importing models from Pytorch, the convention for parameters naming needs to be aligned with the Rust schema. Loading of the pre-trained weights will fail if any of the model parameters weights cannot be found in the weight files.
//! If this quality check is to be skipped, an alternative method `load_partial` can be invoked from the variables store.
//!
//! Pretrained models are available on Hugging face's [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=rust) and can be loaded using `RemoteResources` defined in this library.
//! A conversion utility script is included in `./utils` to convert Pytorch weights to a set of weights compatible with this library. This script requires Python and `torch` to be set-up, and can be used as follows:
//! `python ./utils/convert_model.py path/to/pytorch_model.bin` where `path/to/pytorch_model.bin` is the location of the original Pytorch weights.
//!
//!
//! ## Async execution
//!
//! Creating any of the models in async context will cause panics! Running extensive calculations like running predictions in a future should be avoided, too ([see here](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/#cpu-bound-tasks-and-blocking-code)).
//!
//! It is recommended to spawn a separate thread for the models. The `async-sentiment` example displays a possible solution you could use to integrate models into async code.
