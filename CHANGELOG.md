# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## Changed
- (BREAKING) Upgraded to `torch` 2.2 (via `tch` 0.15.0).

## [0.22.0] - 2024-01-20
## Added
- Addition of `new_with_tokenizer` constructor for `SentenceEmbeddingsModel` allowing passing custom tokenizers for sentence embeddings pipelines.
- Support for [Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) in pipelines, allowing loading `tokenizer.json` and `special_token_map.json` tokenizer files. 
- (BREAKING) Most model configuration can now take an optional `kind` parameter to specify the model weight precision. If not provided, will default to full precision on CPU, or the serialized weights precision otherwise.

## Fixed
- (BREAKING) Fixed the keyword extraction pipeline for n-gram sizes > 2. Add new configuration option `tokenizer_forbidden_ngram_chars` to specify characters that should be excluded from n-grams (allows filtering n-grams spanning multiple sentences).
- Improved MPS device compatibility setting the `sparse_grad` flag to false for `gather` operations
- Updated ONNX runtime backend version to 1.15.x
- Issue with incorrect results for QA models with a tokenizer not using segment ids
- Issue with GPT-J that was incorrectly tracking the gradients for the attention bias

## Changed
- (BREAKING) Upgraded to `torch` 2.1 (via `tch` 0.14.0).
- (BREAKING) Text generation traits and pipelines (including conversation, summarization and translation) now return a `Result` for improved error handling

## [0.21.0] - 2023-06-03
## Added
- Addition of the [LongT5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07916) model architecture and pretrained weights.
- Addition of `add_tokens` and `add_extra_ids` interface methods to the `TokenizerOption`. Allow building most pipeline with custom tokenizer via `new_with_tokenizer`.

- Integration of ONNX models to the sequence classification, token classification, question answering, zero-shot classification, text generation, summarization and translation pipelines

## Changed
- Bumped the tokenizers dependency from 7.x to 8.x, exposing additional options for special token mapping and adding the NLLBTokenizer
- (BREAKING) Simplified the generation traits (removal of LMHeadModel and elimination of unnecessary specification for LanguageGenerator)
- (BREAKING) Upgraded to `torch` 2.0 (via `tch` 0.13.0). The process to automatically download the dependencies have changed, it must now be enabled via the `download-libtorch` feature flag.
- Read the `decoder_start_token_id` from the provided configuration rather than using a hard-coded default value
- (BREAKING) Changed the return type of the `LanguageGenerator` and pipelines functions `float`, `half`, `set_device` to `Result<(), RustBertError>` as these become fallible for ONNX models
- (BREAKING) Wrapped the model resources specification for the pipeline `Config` objects into an `Enum` to allow handling both torch-based and ONNX models. 
  The `model_resources` field now needs to be wrapped in the corresponding enum variant, e.g. `model_resources: ModelResources::TORCH(model_resource)` for Torch-based models
- (BREAKING) Added the `forced_bos_token_id` and `forced_eos_token_id` fields to text generation models. 
  If these are not None, this will trigger a forced BOS/EOS token generation at the first of `max_length` positions (aligns with the Pytorch Transformers library)
- Project structure refactoring (torch-based models moved under common module). Non-breaking change via re-exports.

## Fixed
- MIN/MAX computation for float-like (was set to infinity instead of min/max)

- Addition of the DeBERTa v2/v3 language model and support for question answering, sequence and token classification
- Addition of a `new_with_tokenizer` method allowing building language model generator with a custom tokenizer (or pairing a tokenizer that was not originally designed with the model, e.g. T5 tokenizer with GPT2 model).
- (BREAKING) Addition of support for mT5 model, addition of new optional fields to T5Config
- Addition of `token_scores` field when `output_scores` is set to `true` for generation, returning the score for each token generated

## [0.17.0] - 2021-12-19
## Changed
- Updated to `tch` 0.6.1 (libtorch 1.10)
- (BREAKING) Simplified the generics for multiple library traits taking as a rule `&[AsRef<str>]` or `&str` as inputs (no longer accepts owned types `Vec` and `String`)

## Added
- (BREAKING) Support for `bad_word_ids` generation, allowing to ban a set of word ids for all model supporting text generation
- Support for half-precision mode for all models (reducing memory footprint). A model can be converted to half-precision by calling the `half()` method on the `VarStore` is it currently stored in. Half-precision Torch kernels are not available for CPU (limited to CUDA devices)
- (BREAKING) Extension of the generation options that can be provided at runtime (after a model has been instantiated with a `GenerateConfig`), allowing to update the generation options from one text generation to another with the same model. This feature is implemented at the `LanguageGenerator` trait level, the high-level `TextGeneration` pipeline API remains unchanged.
- Addition of the FNet language model and support for sequence, token and multiple choice classification, question answering

- (BREAKING) Support for `output_scores` boolean argument for generation, allowing users to output the log-probability scores of generated sequences. Updated the return type of low-level generate API to `GeneratedTextOutput` and `GeneratedIndicesOutput` containing optional scores along with the generated output.
- Addition of the MBart Language model and support for text generation / direct translation between 50 language
- Addition of the M2M100 Language model and support for text generation / direct translation between 100 language

## Changed
- Updated GPT2 architecture to re-use embeddings for the output projection layer (resulting in smaller model weights files and memory footprint)
- Upgraded `tch` version to 0.5.0 (using `libtorch` 1.9.0)
- Changed default value of `no_repeat_ngram_size` for text generation from 3 to 0, aligning with [Python's Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/model.html?highlight=no_repeat_ngram_size#transformers.generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate)
- Added the possibility to handle long inputs for token classification tasks (exceeding the model maximum length) using sliding windows over the input
- (BREAKING) Generalized borrowing of Tensors as input for models

## [0.15.1] - 2021-06-01
### Fixed
- Fixed conversation model panic for user inputs exceeding the maximum model length (1000 tokens)
- Fixed translation model panic for user inputs exceeding the maximum number of position embeddings

## [0.15.0] - 2021-05-16
### Added
- Addition of translation language pairs: 
  - English <-> Chinese (Simplified)
  - English <-> Chinese (Traditional)
  - English <-> Dutch
  - English <-> Swedish
  - English <-> Arabic
  - English <-> Hebrew
  - English <-> Hindi
- Addition of a Part of Speech pipeline. This pipeline allows predicting the POS tag (e.g. Noun, Adjective, Verb) of words in input sentences.
- Addition of a lightweight English Part of Speech tagging pretrained MobileBERT model
- Addition of the Pegasus language model and support for conditional generation
- Addition of a model for Pegasus summarization pretrained on the CNN-DM dataset
- Addition of the GPT-Neo language model and pretrained snapshots (125M, 1.3B and 2.7B parameters). Registration of GPT-Neo as an option for `TextGenerationPipeline`.

### Changed
- (BREAKING) Changed `classif_dropout` in `BartConfig` to be an optional field. This affects dependencies instantiating `BartConfig` from scratch, or using `classif_config` for custom model heads.
- (BREAKING) Changed token classification pipelines to return a Vec<Vec<Token>> instead of a Vec<Token>. The token-level predictions are now returned in separate vectors for each input sequence provided as an input (they were previously returned in a flattened vector)
- Simplification of the BART language model code base (also used for Marian and Pegasus language models)
- (BREAKING) Updated to `tch 0.4.1` (based on `libtorch 1.8.1`)

### Fixed
- Fixed character indexing error for Question Answering pipeline answers

### Removed
- Dependency to `itertools` crate

## [0.14.0] - 2021-02-22
### Added
- Addition of the Longformer language model, task-specific heads and registration in relevant pipelines

### Changed
- (BREAKING) Exposed additional settings for the Question Answering pipeline related to the maximum question, context and answer length. This is not backward compatible if the question answering configuration was created without using the `new` creator.
- Simplified the Question answering pipeline to rely on the offsets calculated by the tokenizers instead of a manual alignment. This results in moderate execution speed improvements for this pipeline.
- Updated the padding strategy for the Question answering pipeline. While before all sequences were padded to a fixed `max_length` (defaulting to 384), the padding is now done dynamically based on the length of the inputs. This results in a significant speed improvement for this pipeline.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug for Question Answering for models that were not based on Wordpiece tokenization (including BPE and unigram based tokenizers). The issue was caused by the pre-tokenization step that was stripping the leading whitespace for all tokens. The performance of these models for QA should improve significantly.

## [0.13.0] - 2021-02-03
### Added
- Addition of the ProphetNet language model, task-specific heads and registration in relevant pipelines
- (BREAKING) Implementation of [Diverse Beam Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02424). This allows the generation of more diverse sequences within the number of beams. Addition of 2 new fields to the `GenerateConfig` that are propagated through all text generation configs (e.g. `TranslationConfig`): 
    - `num_beam_groups` (`Option<i64>`), indicating the number of sub-beam groups. This must be a divisor of the number of beams.
    - `diversity_penalty` (`Option<f64>`), indicating by which amount to penalize common words between beam groups. This will default to 5.5 if not provided. The impact of this diverse beam search is illustrated in the GPT2 integration tests.

### Changed
- (BREAKING) Simplified the input and output of encoder/decoder models to avoid needing to take ownership of the possibly cached encoder hidden state, offering a minor performance improvement for text generation tasks. The model output field for encoder hidden states are now optional, and only returned if the encoder hidden states were not provided for the given forward path. This may be a breaking change for low-level dependencies that manipulate directly the encoder/decoder model outputs.
- (BREAKING) Moved the language models implementation of the `PrivateLanguageGenerator` and `LanguageGenerator` traits (needed to generate text) to the model modules, cleaning up the generation_utils module.
- Updated download utilities crate, now leveraging Tokio 1.0 runtimes.

### Fixed
- Updated padding information and addition of position ids for batched GPT2 generation. Prior to this change, inputs that required padding had a lower quality for the text generated.
